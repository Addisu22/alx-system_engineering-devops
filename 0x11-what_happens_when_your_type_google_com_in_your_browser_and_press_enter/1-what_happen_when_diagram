DNS, which stands for Domain Name System, is essentially a dictionary that maps URLs of Internet resources to their corresponding IP addresses. Most people call it "the phonebook of the Internet".

In most cases, the IP of the first outbound DNS server is provided by the ISP, which can be configured on a per-router or per-machine basis. It's also possible to use any other DNS server by setting the corresponding IP address in system's settings.

Any individual DNS server may route a query to a different DNS server if it doesn't have the requested DNS record.

Browsers and operating systems have their own local DNS cache which helps avoid querying DNS servers every time.
