<h2>Postmortem</h2>
Learning how to write an Incident Report, also referred to as a Postmortem. This postmortem follows the guidelines used closely by google engineers to file reports. The report is made up of five parts, an issue summary, a timeline, root cause analysis, resolution and recovery, and lastly, corrective and preventative measures. Lets review each of these parts in detail.

<h3>Issue Summary</h3>
<ul><li>short summary (5 sentences)</li>
<li>list the duration along with start and end times (include timezone)</li>
<li>state the impact (most user requests resulted in 500 errors, at peak 100%)
<li>close with root cause</li></ul>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<ul><li> the timezone</li>
<li>covers the outage duration</li>
<li>when outage began</li>
<li>when staff was notified</li>
<li>actions, events, â€¦</li>
<li>when service was restored</li></ul>
Root Cause
give a detailed explanation of event

Resolution and recovery

Corrective and Preventative Measures
